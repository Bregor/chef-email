Usage
-----
#### email::default
At first you need a databag (named 'domainkeys' by default) with at least one encrypted item.
Item should contain key `private_key` with private DKIM key for domain as value named as item itself.
End of lines should be changed to '\n'.

Then just include `email` and list of domains to your node:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "normal": {
    "email": {
      "domains": [
        "mydomain.com",
        "hisdomain.com",
        "herdomain.com"
      ]
    }
  },
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[email]"
  ]
}
```

Be sure you have proper `data_bag_items` for all your domains.
